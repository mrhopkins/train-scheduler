# Train Scheduler

http://mrhopkins.github.io/train-scheduler

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
  
  * When adding trains, users are be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * The app calculates when the next train will arrive, relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines are be able to view same train times.
